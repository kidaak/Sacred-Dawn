                                | a group of friends that played FFXI together for years. That group was then led in
                                | FFXI by Kailok in a linkshell called Twilight Edge, a linkshell that has been
                                | reincarnate in FFXIV our relationships across Free Companies.
                            p
                                | In FFXI, Twilight Edge was a successful social and endgame linkshell that was active
                                | in Sky and Limbus, and would frequently help other players to get access to Sky and

                                | eventually becoming the group known today as Sacred Dawn. Sacred Dawn has beaten many
                                | of the Extreme Primals and frequenty runs Second Coil of Bahamut with players inside
                                | and outside the Free Company.
